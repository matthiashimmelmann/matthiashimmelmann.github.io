<p style="font-size: 90%;">At the Universität Potsdam and Berlin Mathematical School, I am studying as a third-year PhD student under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/applied-geometry-and-topology/team/prof-dr-myfanwy-evans/">Myfanwy Evans</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/alexander-heaton/home">Alexander Heaton</a>. My main fields of interest are applied algebraic geometry and data science. I am always looking for interesting ways to intersect these topics.  </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">Using code, I develop tools that help to model and visualize mathematics. At the moment, I am trying to apply algebro-geometric techniques to better understand discontinuous behavior in materials, especially tensegrity frameworks, funded by the <a href="https://www.discretization.de/">SFB Transregio 109 - Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics</a>. Furthermore, I am interested in modelling porous materials such as sponge phases, aided by minimal surfaces. </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">My Bachelor's thesis <a href="https://matthiashimmelmann.github.io/documents/bachelorarbeit.pdf">"Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups on Riemann Surfaces"</a> at Freie Universität Berlin was advised by <a href="http://www.math.titech.ac.jp/~shanekelly/">Shane Kelly</a> and treated categorial equivalences between specific function fields and the fundamental group on smooth surfaces. I received the <a href="https://www.math.berlin/preise/bachelorpreise-bmg.html#BMGTag2018">bachelor's prize of the Berlin Mathematical Society</a> for it. My Master's thesis <a href="https://matthiashimmelmann.github.io/documents/Masterarbeit_Himmelmann_GPCA.pdf">"Generalized Principal Component Analysis on Algebraic Varieties"</a> was also conducted at Freie Universität Berlin, with the goal of developing a robust method for finding vanishing ideals from point samples. I was advised by <a href="https://sascha.timme.xyz/">Sascha Timme</a> and supervised by <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/">Bernd Sturmfels</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">Outside of academia, I enjoy cooking and consuming delicious food, coding, traveling, playing board games, climbing and solving puzzles.</p>
