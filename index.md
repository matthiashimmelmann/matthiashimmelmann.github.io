<p style="font-size: 90%;"> Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics in the Brown University. My main fields of interest are applied algebraic geometry, geometric modeling and the development of (numerical) software-solutions for mathematical problems. I am always looking for interesting ways to intersect these topics. </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">Using code, I develop tools that help to model and visualize mathematics. At the moment, I am trying to apply algebro-geometric techniques to better understand discontinuous behavior in materials, especially tensegrity frameworks. Furthermore, I am interested in modelling porous materials such as sponge phases, aided by minimal surfaces. </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">My Bachelor's thesis <a href="https://matthiashimmelmann.github.io/documents/bachelorarbeit.pdf">"Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups on Riemann Surfaces"</a> at Freie Universität Berlin was advised by <a href="http://www.math.titech.ac.jp/~shanekelly/">Shane Kelly</a> and treated categorial equivalences between specific function fields and the fundamental group on smooth surfaces. I received the <a href="https://www.math.berlin/preise/bachelorpreise-bmg.html#BMGTag2018">bachelor's prize of the Berlin Mathematical Society</a> for it.</p> 
<p style="font-size: 90%;">My Master's thesis <a href="https://matthiashimmelmann.github.io/documents/Masterarbeit_Himmelmann_GPCA.pdf">"Generalized Principal Component Analysis on Algebraic Varieties"</a> was also conducted at Freie Universität Berlin, with the goal of developing a robust method for finding vanishing ideals from point samples. I was advised by <a href="https://sascha.timme.xyz/">Sascha Timme</a> and supervised by <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/">Bernd Sturmfels</a>. </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">With my Ph.D. thesis entitled <a href="https://doi.org/10.25932/publishup-66927">"Optimization in Geometric Materials"</a>, I completed my Ph.D. in 2025 at the Universität Potsdam and Berlin Mathematical School under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/applied-geometry-and-topology/team/prof-dr-myfanwy-evans/">Myfanwy Evans</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/alexander-heaton/home">Alexander Heaton</a>. My doctoral studies were funded by the <a href="https://www.discretization.de/">SFB Transregio 109 - Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics</a>. </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">Outside of academia, I enjoy cooking and consuming delicious food, coding, traveling, playing board games, playing football and solving puzzles. </p>
