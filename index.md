At the Universit√§t Potsdam and Berlin Mathematical School, I am studying as a first year PhD student under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/applied-geometry-and-topology/team/prof-dr-myfanwy-evans/">Myfanwy Evans</a>. My main fields of interest are applied algebraic geometry and data science.  I am always looking for interesting ways to intersect these topics.  

Using code, I develop tools that help to model and visualize mathematics. At the moment, I am trying to apply algebro-geometric techniques to better understand discontinuous behavior of materials, especially tensegrity frameworks.
