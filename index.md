description: Postdoc at Technische Universität Braunschweig.

<p style="font-size: 90%;"> Currently, I am a postdoc at the Applied Algebra group of <a href="http://www.iaa.tu-bs.de/AppliedAlgebra/group/index.html">Timo de Wolff</a> at the Technische Universität Braunschweig. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) at Brown University in the context of the Semester program on <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/program/semester_program/sp-s25#section-3">Geometry of Materials, Packings and Rigid Frameworks</a>. My main fields of interest are applied algebraic geometry, geometric modeling and the development of (numerical) software-solutions for mathematical problems. I am always looking for interesting ways to intersect these topics. </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">Using code, I develop tools that help to model and visualize mathematics. At the moment, I am trying to apply algebro-geometric techniques to better understand discontinuous behavior in materials, especially tensegrity frameworks. Furthermore, I am interested in modeling porous materials such as sponge phases, aided by minimal surfaces. </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">With my Ph.D. thesis entitled <a href="https://doi.org/10.25932/publishup-66927">"Optimization in Geometric Materials"</a>, I completed my Ph.D. at the Universität Potsdam and Berlin Mathematical School under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/applied-geometry-and-topology/team/prof-dr-myfanwy-evans/">Myfanwy Evans</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/alexander-heaton/home">Alexander Heaton</a>. My doctoral studies were funded by the <a href="https://www.discretization.de/">SFB Transregio 109 - Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics</a>. </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">My Master's thesis <a href="https://matthiashimmelmann.github.io/documents/Masterarbeit_Himmelmann_GPCA.pdf">"Generalized Principal Component Analysis on Algebraic Varieties"</a> was conducted at Freie Universität Berlin, with the goal of developing a robust method for finding vanishing ideals from point samples. I was advised by <a href="https://sascha.timme.xyz/">Sascha Timme</a> and supervised by <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/">Bernd Sturmfels</a>. </p>
<p style="font-size: 90%;">My Bachelor's thesis <a href="https://matthiashimmelmann.github.io/documents/bachelorarbeit.pdf">"Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups on Riemann Surfaces"</a> at Freie Universität Berlin was advised by <a href="http://www.math.titech.ac.jp/~shanekelly/">Shane Kelly</a> and treated categorial equivalences between specific function fields and the fundamental group on smooth surfaces. I received the <a href="https://www.math.berlin/preise/bachelorpreise-bmg.html#BMGTag2018">bachelor's prize of the Berlin Mathematical Society</a> for it.</p> 
<p style="font-size: 90%;">Outside of academia, I enjoy cooking and consuming delicious food, coding, traveling, playing board games, playing football and solving puzzles. </p>
